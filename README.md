# Path Finder in Java

This is a simple path-finding project built using *Java. It implements basic path-finding algorithms like **Dijkstra's Algorithm* to find the shortest path between two points on a grid map. This project is being built as part of my preparation for *Google Summer of Code (GSoC)*.

## Features

- Input map as grid  
- Start and End selection  
- Find shortest path using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm (Work In Progress)

## How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Arpit001-cell/Path-Finder-java.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd Path-Finder-java

# Compile the Java file
javac Main.java

# Run the program
java Main
