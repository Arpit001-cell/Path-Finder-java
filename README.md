# Path Finder in Java

This is a simple path-finding project built using Java. The goal is to implement basic path-finding algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* to find the shortest path between two points on a map.

## Features
- Input map as grid
- Start and End selection
- Find shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm (work in progress)

## Future Scope
- Add GUI interface
- Add real map integration
- Add A* algorithm support

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
3. Compile and run the main class
